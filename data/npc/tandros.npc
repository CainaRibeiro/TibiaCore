"time"     -> "It is a crime against the order of things to try measuring time. The very thought of squeezing the majesty of centuries and centuries into a puny mechanical device is blasphemy."
"king"     -> "Our king is a worldly one. But if you buy enough of my fluids and runes you might become the king of magic one day."
"venore"   -> "Technically I am an employee of those trade barons of Venore but of course no one can control my magnificent mind."

"apes"       -> "They are attacking travellers and even our settlement now and then. What can be a better way for you to survive than by preparing yourself well and to buy enough fluids and runes?"
"lizard"    -> "The lizards live far away on the other side of the dangerous jungle. If you want to go there to learn more about their secrets, I strongly advise you to supply yourself with runes and fluids."
